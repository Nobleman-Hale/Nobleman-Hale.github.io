		<h1> Analysis of various websites </h1>
		<h2>
			<section>
				<h3><a href="https://arngren.net/" target="_blank">Arngen.net</a></h3>
				<p>Arngren appears to be a site for buying various things, though primarily motorbikes in Norway. I can't figure much else out due to the language barrier unfortunatley. 
				It's really hard to describe how bad this website is, there's different font colors all over the place, so it's hard to tell what indicates what. There's no glimmer of repetition. It's just a mess, full stop. </p>
				<h3><a href="https://www.virginatlantic.com/us/en">Virgin America</a></h3>
				<p> Virgin Atlantic is a company dedicated to travel around the globe. Their website seems to follow some fantastic design convention. Everything is colored according to Virgin's colors, 
				with the addtion of contrasgint colors for readability. Fonts are repeated throughout the page, and are all clean, professional fonts.</p>

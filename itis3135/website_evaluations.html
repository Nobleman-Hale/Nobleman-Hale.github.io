		<h1> Analysis of various websites </h1>
		<h2>
			<section>
				<h3><a href="https://arngren.net/" target="_blank">Arngen.net</a></h3>
				<p>Arngren appears to be a site for buying various things, though primarily motorbikes in Norway. I can't figure much else out due to the language barrier unfortunatley.</p>
				<ul>
				<li> Contrast: Color is all over the place, stark white mixed with blue green and red. None of those colors provide decent information.</li>
				<li> Repetition: Every box is a different size, I can't even begin to understand what box means what on this site, and some products don't even have boxes! </li>
				<li> Aligment: See previous about boxes. It's more like a collage than a storefront.</li>
				<li> Proximity: Everything is close together, meaning I can't tell what is and isnt' related. </li>
				</ul>
				<h3><a href="https://www.virginatlantic.com/us/en">Virgin America</a></h3>
				<p> Virgin Atlantic is a company dedicated to travel around the globe. Their website seems to follow some fantastic design convention.</p>
				<ul>
				<li> Contrast: Color looks great! It uses contrasting colors in addition to the Virgin Atlantic brand colors to make a soft website</li>
				<li> Repetition: Font colors are reused throughout the website, genuinely looks amazing. Fonts are all decently professional as well.</li>
				<li> Aligment: Everythinhg is centered and stacks up nicely</li>
				<li> Proximity: Things in the various stacked boxes on this webpage are all close together, making them easy to ready in addition to the affromentioned colored boxes. </li>
				</ul>
